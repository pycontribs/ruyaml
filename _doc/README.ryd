# ruamel.yaml

`ruamel.yaml` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

--- !table
version: !Env version 
updated: !Env date

As announced, in 0.18.0, the old PyYAML functions have been deprecated.
(`scan`, `parse`, `compose`, `load`, `emit`, `serialize`, `dump` and their variants
(`_all`, `safe_`, `round_trip_`, etc)). If you only read this after your program has 
stopped working: I am sorry to hear that, but that also means you, or the person 
developing your program, has not tested with warnings on (which is the recommendation 
in PEP 565, and e.g. defaultin when using `pytest`). If you have troubles, explicitly use
```
pip install "ruamel.yaml<0.18.0"
```
or put something to that effects in your requirments, to give yourself
some time to solve the issue.

There will be at least one more potentially breaking change in the 0.18 series: `YAML(typ='unsafe')`
now has a pending deprecation warning and is going to be deprecated, probably before the end of 2023.
If you only use it to dump, please use the new `YAML(typ='full')`, the result of that can be *safely*
loaded with a default  instance `YAML()`, as that will get you inspectable, tagged, scalars, instead of
executed Python functions/classes. (You should probably add constructors for what you actually need, 
but I do consider adding a `ruamel.yaml.unsafe` package that will re-add the `typ='unsafe'` option.
*Please adjust/pin your dependencies accordingly if necessary.*


There seems to be a CVE on `ruamel.yaml`, stating that the `load()` function could be abused 
because of unchecked input. `load()` was never the default function (that was `round_trip_load()`
before the new API came into existence`. So the creator of that CVE was ill informed and
probably lazily assumed that since `ruamel.yaml` is a derivative of PyYAML (for which
a similar CVE exists), the same problem would still exist, without checking. 
So the CVE was always inappriate,  now just more so, as the call
to the function `load()` with any input will terminate your program with an error message. If you 
(have to) care about such things as this CVE, my recommendation is to stop using Python
completely, as `pickle.load()` can be abused in the same way as `load()` (and like unlike `load()` 
is only documented to be unsafe, without development-time warning. 

Version 0.17.21 was the last one tested to be working on Python 3.5 and 3.6<BR>
The 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to be working on Python 2.7.


There are two extra plug-in packages
(`ruamel.yaml.bytes` and `ruamel.yaml.string`)
for those not wanting to do the streaming to a
`io.BytesIO/StringIO` buffer themselves.

If your package uses `ruamel.yaml` and is not listed on PyPI, drop me an
email, preferably with some information on how you use the package (or a
link to the repository) and I'll keep you informed when the status of
the API is stable enough to make the transition.
