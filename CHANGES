  - fix for issue 127: tagged scalars were always quoted and seperated
    by a newline when in a block sequence (reported and largely fixed by
    `Tommy Wang <https://bitbucket.org/twang817/>`_)

  - a set() with duplicate elements now throws error in rt loading
  - support for toplevel column zero literal/folded scalar in explicit documents

[0, 15, 5]: 2017-06-08
  - repeat `load()` on a single `YAML()` instance would fail.

  - `transform` parameter on dump that expects a function taking a
    string and returning a string. This allows transformation of the output
    before it is written to stream.
  - some updates to the docs

(0, 15, 3) 2017-06-07:
  - No longer try to compile C extensions on Windows. Compilation can be forced by setting
    the environment variable `RUAMEL_FORCE_EXT_BUILD` to some value
    before starting the `pip install`.

(0, 15, 1) 2017-06-07:
  - Any `duplicate keys  <http://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#duplicate-keys>`_
    in mappings generate an error (in the old API this change generates a warning until 0.16)
  - dependecy on ruamel.ordereddict for 2.7 now via extras_require

(0, 15, 0) 2017-06-04:
  - it is no allowed to pass in a ``pathlib.Path`` as "stream" parameter to all
    load/dump functions
  - passing in a non-supported object (e.g. a string) as "stream" will result in a
    much more meaningful YAMLStreamError.
  - assigning a normal string value to an existing CommentedMap key or CommentedSeq
    element will result in a value cast to the previous value's type if possible.

(0, 14, 7) 2017-04-18:
  - round trip of integers (decimal, octal, hex, binary) now preserve
    leading zero(s) padding and underscores. Underscores are presumed
    to be at regular distances (i.e. ``0o12_345_67`` dumps back as
    ``0o1_23_45_67`` as the space from the last digit to the
    underscore before that is the determining factor).

(0, 14, 6) 2017-04-14:
  - binary, octal and hex integers are now preserved by default. This
    was a known deficiency. Working on this was prompted by the issue report (112)
    from devnoname120, as well as the additional experience with `.replace()`
    on `scalarstring` classes.
  - fix issues 114 cannot install on Buildozer (reported by mixmastamyk).
    Setting env. var ``RUAMEL_NO_PIP_INSTALL_CHECK`` will suppress ``pip``-check.

  - updates for mypy --strict
  - preparation for moving away from inheritance in Loader and Dumper, calls from e.g.
    the Representer to the Serializer.serialize() are now done via the attribute
    .serializer.serialize(). Usage of .serialize() outside of Serializer will be
    deprecated soon

  - optimisations on memory usage when loading YAML from large files (py3 -50%, py2 -85%)

(0.13.0) 2016-11-20:
  - if ``load()`` or ``load_all()`` is called with only a single argument
    (stream or string)
    a UnsafeLoaderWarning will be issued once. If appropriate you can surpress this
    warning by filtering it. Explicitly supplying the ``Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader``
    argument, will also prevent it from being issued. You should however consider
    using ``safe_load()``, ``safe_load_all()`` if your YAML input does not use tags.
  - allow adding comments before and after keys (based on

    Fix issue 72 (reported by Shalon Wood)
  - |
    Slightly smarter behaviour dumping strings when no style is
    specified. Single string scalars that start with single quotes
    or have newlines now are dumped double quoted "'abc\nklm'" instead of

      '''abc

        klm'''

(0.12.14) 2016-09-21:

   Christopher Lambert)

(0.12.10) 2016-09-05:
 - Make previous fix depend on unicode char width (32 bit unicode support
   is a problem on MacOS reported by David Tagatac)

(0.12.8) 2016-09-05:
   - To be ignored Unicode characters were not properly regex matched
     (no specific tests, PR by Haraguroicha Hsu)

     (reported by Alex Harvey)

(0.12.5) 2016-08-20:
  - fixing issue 45 preserving datetime formatting (submitted by altuin)
    Several formatting parameters are preserved with some normalisation:
  - preserve 'T', 't' is replaced by 'T', multiple spaces between date
    and time reduced to one.
  - optional space before timezone is removed
  - still using microseconds, but now rounded (.1234567 -> .123457)
  - Z/-5/+01:00 preserved

(0.12.4) 2016-08-19:
  - Fix for issue 44: missing preserve_quotes keyword argument (reported
    by M. Crusoe)

(0.12.3) 2016-08-17:
  - correct 'in' operation for merged CommentedMaps in round-trip mode
    (implementation inspired by J.Ngo, but original not working for merges)
  - iteration over round-trip loaded mappings, that contain merges. Also
    keys(), items(), values() (Py3/Py2) and iterkeys(), iteritems(),
    itervalues(), viewkeys(), viewitems(), viewvalues() (Py2)
  - reuse of anchor name now generates warning, not an error. Round-tripping such
    anchors works correctly. This inherited PyYAML issue was brought to attention
    by G. Coddut (and was long standing https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=515634)
    suppressing the warning::

        import warnings
        from ruamel.yaml.error import ReusedAnchorWarning
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore", ReusedAnchorWarning)

(0.12.2) 2016-08-16:

  - drop support for Python 2.6
  - include initial Type information (inspired by M. Crusoe)

(0.11.14) 2016-07-06:
  - fix preserve_quotes missing on original Loaders (as reported
    by Leynos, bitbucket issue 38)
